## Development

If you want to use this website as a starting point for your own site, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

Then, fill in the environment variables in the `.env` file.

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Also, if you're using it as a template, would be awesome if you could give me credit by linking to my [GitHub](https://github.com/philparzer) or [x.com](https://twitter.com/parzerp).
